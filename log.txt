### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

In some advertisements, etc it's often called gold gilt as well.
Not very valuable as a general rule though.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
The wavelength and frequency of light are closely related.
The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.
Because all light waves move through a vacuum at the same speed, the number of wave crests passing by a given point in one second depends on the wavelength.
Wavelength is a measure of the period length and is used for Spectrum readings and micro-signal applications, mainly in Physics or chemistry.
For example visible light has a wavelength between 400 - 700 nanometers for the visible spectrum.
There is the Infrared spectrum, radio spectrum, radiation spectrum, television spectrum, etc.
There is continuing research and studies being done on these topics you ask about.
· just now.
Report Abuse.
Amplitude is the height of the wave above the middle point, or the x-axis, if it is on a graph.
Period is the same thing as wavelength if we are talking about something on a graph; both are the length on the x axis of one 'cycle' of the wave.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

A strikebreaker (sometimes derogatorily called a scab, blackleg, or knobstick) is a person who works despite an ongoing strike.
Strikebreakers are usually individuals who are not employed by the company prior to the trade union dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running.
Lexicographer Geoffrey Hughes, however, notes that blackleg and scab are both references to disease, as in the blackleg infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle caused by Clostridium chauvoei.
He dates the first use of the term blackleg in reference to strikebreaking to the United Kingdom in 1859.

### Passage: 
The speed of light squared is a colossal number, illustrating just how much energy there is in even tiny amounts of matter.
A common example of this is that 1 gram of water -- if its whole mass were converted into pure energy via E=mc² -- contains as much energy as 20,000 tons (18,143 metric tons) of TNT exploding.
Now we're getting to the c² part of the equation, which serves the same purpose as the star-on and star-off machines in The Sneetches..
The c stands for the speed of light, a universal constant, so the whole equation breaks down to this: Energy is equal to matter multiplied by the speed of light squared.

### FOL Translation of passage: 
∀x (SpeedOfLightSquared(x) ⊕ Colossal(x))
∀x (GramOfWater(x) ∨ (Mass(x) ∧ Energy(x)))

∀x (Mass(x) ∧ Energy(x) ∧ Energy(x) = EnergyFromTNT(18143)) → Energy(x) = EnergyFromTNT(18143))

### Passage: 
On most interferential units, and on some TENS units, there is also a timer.
Most timers can be set for 15, 30, 45 minutes of stimulation, or set on Continuous mode.
If 15,30 or 45 minutes of treatment occurs and the unit goes off, but the pain comes back, then switch to Continuous and wear until the pain is gone.
With tens or interferential one can use the unit anytime there is pain present.
If using tens or interferential and its difficult to sleep, due to pain, then wear the unit all night long if it helps the pain go away and one can sleep.
Unlike pain medications the goal with interferential is to not have to use the unit, to extend the carryover pain period and not be in pain.
With medications it can be the opposite and the patient is increasing the frequency of taking pills, or asking for more or stronger drugs..
Yes.
With tens or interferential one can use the unit anytime there is pain present.
If using tens or interferential and its difficult to sleep, due to pain, then wear the unit all night long if it helps the pain go away and one can sleep.
The explanation for this is the purpose of tens or interferential is to get rid of the pain signal.
Neither a tens or interferential unit is meant for the patient to feel the unit all the time.
The purpose is for the patient to not be in pain and to not feel pain..
No again the purpose is to not feel pain.
With tens or interferential one can use the unit anytime there is pain present.
If using tens or interferential and its difficult to sleep, due to pain, then wear the unit all night long if it helps the pain go away and one can sleep.

### Passage: 
Pumice /ˈpʌmɨs/ , called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals.
It is typically light colored.
Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.
Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is violently ejected from a volcano.
The unusual foamy configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization.
It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known.
Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to green-brown or black.

Example:

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

You are given a question and a selected passage that provides context. 
Provide a clear and concise answer in natural language to the question using the information from the passage paired with the First-order Logic Translations.

Follow this example:

Example:

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

The population was 42,434 at the 2010 census, up from 41,103 at the 2000 census.
Prior to the European settlements, the area around Lompoc was inhabited by the Chumash.
It is from that portion that the present-day Lompoc was established as a temperance colony.
The town was originally intended to be called New Vineland, modeled after the temperance colony in New Jersey.
Lompoc then became a military town with the completion of nearby Camp Cooke (now, Vandenberg Air Force Base).

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
Studies have shown that when magnesium intake is low, calcium supplementation may reduce magnesium absorption and retention.
And, whereas calcium supplementation can have negative effects on magnesium levels, magnesium supplementation actually improves the body’s use of calcium.

Most dark colored sodas contain phosphates.
These substances actually bind with magnesium inside the digestive tract, rendering it unavailable to the body.
So even if you are eating a balanced diet, by drinking soda with your meals you are flushing magnesium out of your system.

All linkage map distances are calculated as the percentage recombination between two loci.
This is reflected in the percentage of recombinant offspring.
A.
If two genes are completely linked, all of the offspring will be parental (have the same linkage as the parents); there will be no recombinant offspring.
Thus the linkage map distance between the two genes would be zero LMU (Linkage Map Units).
B.
If the genes are on separate chromosomes (or are far enough apart that crossing over between them occurs in virtually all meioses), half of the offspring will be recombinant, the other half parental.

Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

Desert Tortoise Diet Sheet.
©1995 Melissa Kaplan.
A desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) diet is comprised mainly of safe grasses and weeds, leafy greens, with small amounts of hard vegetables and moist fruits.
A good basic salad can be prepared a week in advance and fed daily with selections from the following served in addition to it.
All tortoises need pesticide-and herbicide-free forage (grasses and weeds) for grazing.
You can grow your own in your backyard and let your tortoises graze on it, after first making sure your yard is escape-proof.
Another way is to build a safe pen or corral for the tortoises, and seed it with the forage.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

The role of testosterone in a man's body.
Testosterone is a hormone made by your body in the testes, the reproductive glands that make sperm.
The amount of testosterone your body produces is controlled by the brain's hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.
Testosterone plays an important role in the body.
It's impact can be seen in:  A testosterone test checks the level of this male hormone (androgen) in the blood.
Testosterone affects sexual features and development.
In men, it is made in large amounts by the testicles.
In both men and women, testosterone is made in small amounts by the adrenal glands, and in women, by the ovaries.
The pituitary gland controls the level of testosterone in the body.
When the testosterone level is low, the pituitary gland releases a hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH) .

In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

Confidence votes 18.5K.
What this refers to is a degenerative disk problem at the middle cervical region of your spine.
The cervical spine is your neck, from the skull to the base of the neck.
The mid-region disks are typically the C5,6 & 7 disks/vertebrae, and they're also the ones most commonly affected by disease.
Discovertebral Complex is just a fancy term for saying you've got degeneration in that area Degenerative disc disease is a disease of aging, an age related disease.
Over the years and decades, the repeated daily stresses on the spine and occasional minor, unnoticed injuries, as well as major ones, begin to take their toll.
For most people the gradual degeneration of the discs is not a problem.
However, in some cases it eventually causes severe, chronic and debilitating discogenic pain.
Back specialists refer to pain caused by a damaged intervertebral disc as discogenic pain.

Recombinant DNA Technology.
Recombinant DNA Technology.
All organisms on Earth evolved from a common ancestor, so all organisms use DNA as their molecule of heredity.
At the chemical level, DNA is the same whether it is taken from a microscopic bacterium or a blue whale.
As a result, DNA from different organisms can be “cut and pasted” together, resulting in “recombinant DNA”.
The first recombinant DNA molecule was produced in 1972 by Stanford researcher Paul Berg.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

Cabbage is ready to harvest in approximately 3-4 months.
Cabbage heads must feel hard and solid before cutting.
When harvesting, use a sharp knife to cut the head off at the base of the plant, keeping a few outer leaves to protect the head.

### Passage: 
But otherwise, the question most groom's face is whether to rent or buy a tuxedo.
Money is the main factor in your wedding formalwear decision.
Renting will cost about 10% to 30% of the price of a new tuxedo, and tuxedo prices begin in the $300 to $500 range.
If you attend three or four formal events per year, buying a tux may be worthwhile.
Look at it as an investment -- you can wear it for years and it will never go out of style.
 According to The Knot, new tuxedos typically cost between $300 and $500 to buy, and renting a tux costs 10 percent to 30 percent of this price.
As such, you can expect to pay between $30 and $150 to rent your tux.
At high-end shops, of course, these prices are higher.
If you attend enough black-tie events so that it's no longer cost effective to repeatedly rent tuxedos, buying one is a smart approach.
If you're on a tight budget, some stores rent the groom's tuxedo for free, provided his groomsmen pay for their tux rentals there.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
Chromosomal disorders of structure occur when there are physical changes to the chromosome that alter its configuration.
In TRANSLOCATION, fragments of a chromosome break away and reattach to other chromosomes or are lost, potentially changing several chromosomes with unpredictable and random results.
Genetic Disorders.
Genetic disorders can happen for many reasons.
Genetic disorders often are described in terms of the chromosome that contains the gene.
If the gene is on one of the first 22 pairs of chromosomes, called the autosomes, the genetic disorder is called an autosomal condition.
If the gene is on the X chromosome, the disorder is called X-linked.
Genetic disorders also are grouped by how they run in families.
Disorders can be dominant or recessive, depending on how they cause conditions and

the use of refrigerator are that it can slow down the bacteria process so you can keep your food for a longer period of time.
 Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models.
Most households use the freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style, which has been the basic style since the 1940s.
A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator–freezers and freezers.
In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior.
1 Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

Delayed / Late Period.
Written by Dr.M.D.Mazumdar, MD.
The length of a normal menstrual cycle is 28 days, plus/minus 7 days.
That is, a period may occur 7 days before the expected date of the period or may be normally delayed for 7 days beyond the expected date.
But, if the delay is more than 35 (28+7) days, then the cause of the delay needs to be investigated.
Periods can be delayed for a single cycle or can be delayed in every cycle

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

Descriptions [edit].
The nature of a convergent boundary depends on the type of plates that are colliding.
Where a dense oceanic plate collides with a less-dense continental plate, the oceanic plate is typically thrust underneath because of the greater buoyancy of the continental lithosphere, forming a subduction zone.
A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust.
The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
In summary, photosynthesis is a process in which light energy is converted to chemical energy and used to produce organic compounds.
In plants, photosynthesis typically occurs within the chloroplasts located in plant leaves.
Photosynthesis consists of two stages, the light reactions and the dark reactions.
The light reactions convert light into energy (ATP and NADHP) and the dark reactions use the energy and carbon dioxide to produce sugar.
In the reduction stage, ATP and NADPH produced in the light reaction stage are used to convert the 6-carbon sugar into two molecules of a 3-carbon carbohydrate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is used to make glucose and fructose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
Swash, in geography, is known as a turbulent layer of water that washes up on the beach after an incoming wave has broken.
The swash action can move beach materials up and down the beach, which results in the cross-shore sediment exchange.
The time-scale of swash motion varies from seconds to minutes depending on the type of beach (see Figure 1 for beach types).
The berm is the relatively planar part of the swash zone where the accumulation of sediment occurs at the landward farthest of swash motion (Figure 2).
The berm protects the backbeach and coastal dunes from waves but erosion can occur under high energy conditions such as storms.

### Passage: 
A hissing cat is basically trying to frighten away whatever or whoever he's hissing at.
Hissing is an act of defense.
The cat is issuing a clear warning saying carry on approaching me at your own risk..
Snakes are one of the most deadly and feared animals.
Some cat behavior experts believe that cats hissing came about through mimicry of snakes and has evolved as a feline defense mechanism.
It's easy to spot the similarities here...
So why do cats hiss and mimic snakes, you may well ask.
A cat that's hissing is trying to frighten whatever it's hissing at.
This usually happens either because it's scared of being attacked, so is trying to face off the would-be attacker, or it's showing aggressive behavior as an act of dominance

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
Caffeine inhibits ADH causing the levels in the body to lower.
Anti-Diuretic Hormone is released when the body wishes to conserve water.
The hormone tells the kidneys to reabsorb more water which results in urine becoming concentrated.
Alcohol has a similar effect which is why, when it inhibits ADH, the body no longer attempts to conserve water.
ADH is a hormone that is released from the posterior pituitary gland that increases water reabsorption in t … he kidneys, resulting in decreased urinary output.
