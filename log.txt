Provide a clear answer in natural language to the question. Always shoewa step-by-step reasoning in the proper space and use the information from the passage paired with the First-order Logic Translations.

Answer only in this format:
### Answer:
correct answer in natural language

### Reasoning:
step by step reasoning which lead to the answer

Follow this example:

Example:

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.
