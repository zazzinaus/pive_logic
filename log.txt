### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
The wavelength and frequency of light are closely related.
The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.
Because all light waves move through a vacuum at the same speed, the number of wave crests passing by a given point in one second depends on the wavelength.
Wavelength is a measure of the period length and is used for Spectrum readings and micro-signal applications, mainly in Physics or chemistry.
For example visible light has a wavelength between 400 - 700 nanometers for the visible spectrum.
There is the Infrared spectrum, radio spectrum, radiation spectrum, television spectrum, etc.
There is continuing research and studies being done on these topics you ask about.

A strikebreaker (sometimes derogatorily called a scab, blackleg, or knobstick) is a person who works despite an ongoing strike.
Strikebreakers are usually individuals who are not employed by the company prior to the trade union dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running.
Lexicographer Geoffrey Hughes, however, notes that blackleg and scab are both references to disease, as in the blackleg infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle caused by Clostridium chauvoei.
He dates the first use of the term blackleg in reference to strikebreaking to the United Kingdom in 1859.

The speed of light squared is a colossal number, illustrating just how much energy there is in even tiny amounts of matter.
A common example of this is that 1 gram of water -- if its whole mass were converted into pure energy via E=mc² -- contains as much energy as 20,000 tons (18,143 metric tons) of TNT exploding.
Now we're getting to the c² part of the equation, which serves the same purpose as the star-on and star-off machines in The Sneetches..
The c stands for the speed of light, a universal constant, so the whole equation breaks down to this: Energy is equal to matter multiplied by the speed of light squared.

One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
On most interferential units, and on some TENS units, there is also a timer.
Most timers can be set for 15, 30, 45 minutes of stimulation, or set on Continuous mode.
If 15,30 or 45 minutes of treatment occurs and the unit goes off, but the pain comes back, then switch to Continuous and wear until the pain is gone.
With tens or interferential one can use the unit anytime there is pain present.
If using tens or interferential and its difficult to sleep, due to pain, then wear the unit all night long if it helps the pain go away and one can sleep.
Unlike pain medications the goal with interferential is to not have to use the unit, to extend the carryover pain period and not be in pain.
With medications it can be the opposite and the patient is increasing the frequency of taking pills, or asking for more or stronger drugs..
Yes.
With tens or interferential one can use the unit anytime there is pain present.
If using tens or interferential and its difficult to sleep, due to pain, then wear the unit all night long if it helps the pain go away and one can sleep.
The explanation for this is the purpose of tens or interferential is to get rid of the pain signal.
Neither a tens or interferential unit is meant for the patient to feel the unit all the time.
The purpose is for the patient to not be in pain and to not feel pain..
No again the purpose is to not feel pain.
With tens or interferential one can use the unit anytime there is pain present.

Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.
Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is violently ejected from a volcano.
The unusual foamy configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization.
It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known.

Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

All linkage map distances are calculated as the percentage recombination between two loci.
This is reflected in the percentage of recombinant offspring.
A.
If two genes are completely linked, all of the offspring will be parental (have the same linkage as the parents); there will be no recombinant offspring.
Thus the linkage map distance between the two genes would be zero LMU (Linkage Map Units).
B.
If the genes are on separate chromosomes (or are far enough apart that crossing over between them occurs in virtually all meioses), half of the offspring will be recombinant, the other half parental.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage:
Lactic acid, also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic or milk acid, is a compound formed when glucose is broken down under certain conditions in a living creature or by some types of bacteria.
In a person, for example, it is an important part of producing energy for strenuous exercise and helps with certain liver functions.
One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
But otherwise, the question most groom's face is whether to rent or buy a tuxedo.
Money is the main factor in your wedding formalwear decision.
Renting will cost about 10% to 30% of the price of a new tuxedo, and tuxedo prices begin in the $300 to $500 range.
If you attend three or four formal events per year, buying a tux may be worthwhile.
Look at it as an investment -- you can wear it for years and it will never go out of style.
 According to The Knot, new tuxedos typically cost between $300 and $500 to buy, and renting a tux costs 10 percent to 30 percent of this price.
As such, you can expect to pay between $30 and $150 to rent your tux.
At high-end shops, of course, these prices are higher.
If you attend enough black-tie events so that it's no longer cost effective to repeatedly rent tuxedos, buying one is a smart approach.
If you're on a tight budget, some stores rent the groom's tuxedo for free, provided his groomsmen pay for their tux rentals there.

### Passage: 
Every glacier has an accumulation zone and an ablation zone.
Between them lies an equilibrium line where accumulation occurs as fast as ablation.
Not only do these zones vary in size, but it's possible for one zone, such as the zone of ablation, to cover an entire glacier; that could happen in a warm year.
Accumulation happens on a glacier's upper regions in the accumulation zone.
Composed mainly of ice with very little new snow, the ablation zone lies at lower altitudes where the glacier is melting, sublimating, or calving, resulting in mass loss.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
On a glacier, the accumulation zone is the area above the firn line, where snowfall accumulates and exceeds the losses from ablation, (melting, evaporation, and sublimation).
The annual Glacier equilibrium line separates the accumulation and ablation zone annually.
The accumulation zone is also defined as the part of a glacier’s surface, usually at higher elevations, on which there is net accumulation of snow, which subsequently turns into firn and then glacier ice.
Part of the glacier where snow builds up and turns to ice moves outward from there.

In summary, photosynthesis is a process in which light energy is converted to chemical energy and used to produce organic compounds.
In plants, photosynthesis typically occurs within the chloroplasts located in plant leaves.
Photosynthesis consists of two stages, the light reactions and the dark reactions.
The light reactions convert light into energy (ATP and NADHP) and the dark reactions use the energy and carbon dioxide to produce sugar.
In the reduction stage, ATP and NADPH produced in the light reaction stage are used to convert the 6-carbon sugar into two molecules of a 3-carbon carbohydrate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

One common use for lactic acid in a human body is the formation of glucose.
Moderate amounts of this acid can move through someone's blood stream and reach the liver, where it undergoes a process called gluconeogenesis to become glucose.

### Passage: 
The kilowatt-hour (symbolized kW⋅h) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power sustained for one hour.
One watt is equal to 1 J/s.
One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour.
Note that the international standard SI unit of energy is the joule.
A kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour, or 3.6 megajoules.
Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example: a 100-watt (i.e.
0.1 kilowatt) light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 W⋅h or 0.8 kW⋅h.
