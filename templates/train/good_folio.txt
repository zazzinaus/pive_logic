### INSTRUCTION
Correct only the following first-order logic premises and conclusion translated from the given natural language statements.
Answer with the correction of the first-order logic statements or only with "N/A" if there are no invalid premises or conclusion.
Only include the FOL rule in the answer box after "### FOL Correction:". Do not add any extra symbols or words to the FOL rule. Do not include any kind of explanation or description in the answer box.
Only symbols admitted for the FOL statements are: '⊕', '∨', '∧', '→', '↔', '∀', '∃', '¬' and nothing else.  Do not use "=", "?", "≥", "≤". Other symbols will lead to a parsing error.
Respond only in this format and nothing else:

### FOL premises: 
Correction of the FOL tranlastion of premises or "N/A" if there invalid premises are None.

### FOL question: 
Correction of the FOL translation of the question or "N/A" if invalid question is None.


Follow this example:

### NL premises:
Cornish Hens.
Cornish chickens are a large English breed with white, black or red feathers.
They are a heritage breed, meaning they've been bred for many years in a particular location with traits conducive to thriving in that environment.
They are now raised by backyard enthusiasts and small farm

### NL question:
what is a cornish hen

### Pred FOL:
### FOL premises: 
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ Chicken(x)) 
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ (Large(x) ∧ English(x) ∧ (Feathers(x = White) ∨ Feathers(x = Black) ∨ Feathers(x = Red)
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ HeritageBreed(x))
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ RaisedBy(BackyardEnthusiasts(x) ∨ RaisedBy(SmallFarm(x))))

### FOL question: 
CornishHen(x)


### Errors:
parsing error
invalid premises
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ (Large(x) ∧ English(x) ∧ (Feathers(x = White) ∨ Feathers(x = Black) ∨ Feathers(x = Red)
invalid question
None

### FOL Correction:
### FOL premises: 
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ Chicken(x)) 
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ (Large(x) ∧ English(x) ∧ (Feathers(x, White) ∨ Feathers(x, Black) ∨ Feathers(x, Red))))
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ HeritageBreed(x))
∀x (CornishHen(x) ⊕ RaisedBy(BackyardEnthusiasts(x) ∨ RaisedBy(SmallFarm(x))))

### FOL question: 
CornishHen(x)

### You are my FOL expert, now correct these:
